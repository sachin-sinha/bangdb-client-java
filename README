BangDB java client is a light weight client for BangDB server 2.0.
It is complete in nature and has same interface as any other clients (c++, c# etc.).
This client uses c++ library (.so) file in turn using JNI hence this library
is needed for it to work. 
Please see https://bangdb.com/developer for sample test file or detail info on BangDB.
There is a sample test file available in the test folder as well here, which you can run
Hope this is useful and helps you building some useful apps that solves some real world problems.
